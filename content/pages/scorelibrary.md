Here are several vClick scores created for the system. Some of them are public -  please feel free to use, study, improve them -  others are private. From the private scores you can find short excerpts to try out the funpelican -s pelicanconf.py -o output contentctionality or learn how they are done. If you need the full score, please contact me and I will connect you with the "owner" of the score.

See more about score file syntax etc [here](score-files.html).
