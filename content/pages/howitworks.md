This is a bit more techical stuff but probably interesting to many people, who undertand the terms like OSC messages, websockets etc - it may help you to use the system in your own setup, write custom clients (like using Processing, Max MSP or any other OSC aware software).

* OSC messages sent

* possible websocket connection to web-based (html5) clients used in browser
