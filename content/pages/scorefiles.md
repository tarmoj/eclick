*You ask:* How can I play a certain piece with eClick system? How does eClick know when to send the the beats? How is the "click-track" done?

eClick needs a special score where everything is defined. It is a plain text file, written in standard Csound score syntax. The  file has usually .sco ending.

You can study [Csound score syntax](https://csound.github.io/docs/manual/ScoreTop.html) and the demo scores:

<https://github.com/tarmoj/eclick/blob/master/server/simple-4-4.sco> (simple 4/4 for 50 bars)

<https://github.com/tarmoj/eclick/blob/master/server/test.sco> (the test score included also in server by default)

to see how it is done. You can write the score files yourself but with more complex pieces it can be quite tricky.

It can be easier to order the score file from me, escpecially since this is a good way to support the project and keep it in development.

###Order the score

Please send the musical score in pdf to me at [trmjhnns ae gmail com](mailto:trmjhnns@gmail.com).

I will have a look and if the piece is possible to transcribe I will write a eClick score according to it and send it back. We must be in good contact meanwhile, of course, to get all details  - like durations of fermatas  etc etc - right.

####How much does it cost?

A simple score - 50 €

Medium or more complex score - 100 €

Very long or complex score or special rewrite for the server software (like having many clictracks going in different tempos) - let's agree.

I will let you know after seeing the score.


Feel free to share the eClick scores or find other people who can help with transcribing the scores.
