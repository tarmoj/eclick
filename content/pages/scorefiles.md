You ask: How does eClick know when to send the the beats? How is the clicktrack done?

Csound score. File with .sco ending

Everyone can write it, but with more complex pieces it can be quite tricky.

It can be better to order the score file from me, escpecially this is a good way to support the project.

###Order the score

Please send the musical score in pdf to me trmjhnns ae gmail com.

I will have a look and if the piece is possible to transcribe I will write a eClick scoreaccording to it and send it back. We must be in good contact meanwhile, of course, to get all details like durations of fermatas right etc.

####How much does it cost?

A simple score - 50 €

Medium or more complex score - 100 €

Very long or complex score or special rewrite for the server software (like having many clictracks going in different tempos) - let's agree.

I will let you know after seeing the score.
